Mary I, daughter of Henry VIII, took the throne in 1553 and was the first ruling queen of England and Ireland. She was a devout Catholic, and in reaction to her Father's creation of the Church of England, she persecuted hundreds of Protestants: thus she became known as "Bloody Mary." What does this have to do with the cocktail of the same name? Well, the tomato juice brings to mind blood, so ... otherwise nothing. The Bloody Mary is a cocktail for which the liquor (vodka) is necessary, but in the background. Use a premade mix or craft your own favorite spicy blend. Garnish ad lib: olive, celery, .... cocktail weiners ... hot wings .... apparently the sky is the limit! This is typically a day-drinking beverage: brunch and tail-gating are its natural venues.
