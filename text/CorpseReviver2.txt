The Corpse Reviver is a family of cocktails traditionally consumed as a hair-of-the-dog, a hangover reliever to refresh and enliven after a night of heavy drinking. They tend to be relatively high-proof and served up, rather than over ice. The earliest known recipe comes from the 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book, a collection of their most popular drinks. Bartender and author Harry Cradock writes “To be taken before 11 a.m., or whenever steam and energy are needed.” Note: this is not advised!
