The classic Daiquiri contains rum, lime juice, and simple syrup. It is a deceptively straightforward cocktail whose proportions can be adjusted to make it more sour or sweet. Because lime juice can greatly vary in its own acidity/sweetness, it is important for the mixologist to sample and adjust! Also, this is a great cocktail to experiment with, and to try the same drink using a variety of rums.
