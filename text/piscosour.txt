Pisco, the Peruvian national spirit, is a brandy (or aguardiente) distilled from fermented grapes. Its name derives from the port town of the Pisco, from where the brandy was exported to Europe. The Pisco sour is the classic preparation and it is uniquely garnished with bitters. NOTE: the "dry shake" is a technique used for most cocktails that contain egg white (or you can substitute aquafaba, the liquid from a can of chickpeas, if you prefer a vegan option) that maximizes the foaminess of the floating topper.
