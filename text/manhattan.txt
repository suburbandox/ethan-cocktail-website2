Each of New York City's borough's has a cocktail named in its honor; of the five, the Manhattan is far and away the most well known. And for good reason. Using high quality whiskey (rye is classic, but don't let anyone tell you that you can't use bourbon), spicy vermouth, and your choice of bitters (Angostura being classic, but chocolate or orange bitters make a tasty alternative) leads to a drink that is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz rye
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Garnish: Luxardo or brandied cherry

## Preparation

1. Fill a shaker or mixing cup with ice
2. Add the bourbon, sweet vermouth, and bitters
3. Stir until well-chilled; pour over large ice cube into rocks glass
4. Garnish with cherries
