The Last Word is an incredibly complex version of the sidecar with two strongly flavored liqueurs (Chartreuse and Luxardo) melding in an herbacious and tasty blend. Be warned: Chartreuse is pricey. Alas, I don't know of any substitute.

## Ingredients

- 3/4 oz gin
- 3/4 oz green Chartreuse
- 3/4 oz Luxardo maraschino liqueur
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

## Preparation

1. Fill a shaker with ice
2. Add the gin, Chartreuse, Luxardo, and lime juice
3. Shake vigorously until well-chilled
4. Strain into chilled coupe or Nick and Nora glasses
