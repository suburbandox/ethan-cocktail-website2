The Mimosa is a classic brunch beverage. Its simplicity means that the flavor depends on the ingredients, thus a sweeter or dryer sparkling wine and fresh or from-concentrate orange juice will make a difference.

## Ingredients

- 1 oz fresh orange juice
- 5 oz cold dry sparkling wine
- lemon twist

## Preparation

1. Pour the OJ into a chilled champagne flute
2. Pour in the sparkling wine and stir very briefly, to avoid losing the bubbles
3. Garnish with lemon twist, if you like
4. Sip!
