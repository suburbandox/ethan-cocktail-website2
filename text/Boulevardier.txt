The Boulevardier is closely related to the Negroni, but with bourbon in place of gin. It was first descdribed in a 1927 bar guide, Barflies and Cocktails, and was named after a magazine of the same name. A Boulevardier was originally a man-about-town who might be found strolling down one of the picturesque Parisian Boulevards.
