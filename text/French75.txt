The French 75 is named for a cannon, used by the French during World War One, that was known for its accuracy and speed. This cocktail was said to have such a kick that it felt like being hit by a 75 mm shell.

## Comments
- The French 75, named for its 75-mm (2.95-inch) bore, was the French army's primary field gun in WWI. It was distinguished from other cannon of its time by its recoil system: the barrel and breech recoiled on rollers while the gun carriage itself remained in place instead of jumping or rolling backward.
