The White Russian is a starter drink for many, as it is sweetish and relatively low proof. In this recipe, using half-and-half instead of heavy cream lightens the drink and does not overwhelm the coffee flavor.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 oz vodka rum
- 1 oz Kahlua or other coffee liqueur
- 1 oz half-and-half
- Garnish: 3 coffee beans

## Preparation

1. Add vodka and coffee liqueur to rocks (lowball) glass
2. Fill glass with ice cubes and stir briefly
3. Layer the half-and-half on top
4. Garnish with three coffee beans
