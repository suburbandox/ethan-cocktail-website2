The Margarita is the most well known tequila-based cocktail; many people have only tried the slushy frozen variety, available in any chain Mexican restaurant. Served on the rocks, with or without a salted rim, it can be an elegant drink with a delicious sweet/sour balance. "Cadillac" versions use more expensive tequilas (classified as anejo or reposado, depending on their age) and various orange-based liqueurs. But this version is delicious
