The gin and tonic is an old British Empire drink; the colonialists learned that quinine, extracted from the bitter bark of the cinchona trees, was effective in combatting malaria. As a result, Africa was no longer a fatal posting for many. To make the medicine more palatable, they added sugar and seltzer. And maybe the botanicals in gin added even more protection? At any rate, it may be that this cocktail was responsible for more misery than any other! Still, it's delicious and refreshing. My favorite gin for G+T's is Tanqueray.
