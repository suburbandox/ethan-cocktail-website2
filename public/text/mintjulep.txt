The Mint Julep is the sweet southern cousin of the Old-Fashioned family. Long associated with the Kentucky Derby, (all true bourbon is made in Bourbon County, Kentucky), this drink's sweet finish masks its punch.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz bourbon
- 1/4 to 1 oz double-strength simple syrup (depending on how sweet you like it)
- 1 mint bouquet
- Garnish: mint leaves

## Preparation

1. Place mint sprigs in cocktail shaker, add bourbon and simple syrup, and muddle well
2. Half-fill glass (classically a silver beaker) with crushed ice, strain bourbon into glass, and mix vigorously.
3. Fill glass with crushed ice and stir until it is completely frosted.
4. Add more crushed ice to form a cone above the rim, garnish with mint sprigs, serve with a straw
