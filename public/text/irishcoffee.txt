Irish Coffee is one of the after-dinner libations that prefigure Red Bull cocktails; caffeine + alcohol. It is decadent and warming. If you must, use canned whipped cream, but the fresh is much better!

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 oz Irish whiskey (like Jameson)
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 3 oz hot coffee
- 2 oz heavy cream

## Preparation

1. Whip the cream by hand (unless making multiples, in which case a mixer might be useful)
2. Pour whiskey and syrup into warmed mugh, then slowly add the coffee while stirring
3. Spoon whipped cream on top of the beverage
