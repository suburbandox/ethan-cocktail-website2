The Stinger is an old drink. Your grandmother may have sipped it in the 30's. It can either be served up or on crushed ice, much like a mint julep.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz cognac
- 1/2 oz white or green creme de menthe
- 1-3 tsp simple syrup, depending on how sweet you prefer
- Garnish: mint sprig

## Preparation

1. Fill a shaker or mixing glass with ice
2. Add the cognac, creme de menthe, and simple syrup
3. Shake vigorously until well-chilled
4. Strain into chilled (fill with ice and let sit) martini, coupe, or Nick and Nora glass; alternatively you can pour over crushed ice in a rocks glass
5. Garnish with mint
