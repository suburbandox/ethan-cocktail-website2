The Paloma is less well known than the Margarita, but arguably a better drink! It can be made with mezcal in place of tequila which provides a smoky kick. At its simplest, it may be served as tequila in grapefruit soda, but pepping it up a bit with grapefruit bitters and lime juice is even better. The Fever Tree grapefruit soda is the bomb!

## Ingredients

- 2 oz tequila
- 2 dashes grapefruit bitters
- 1/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 4 oz graperfuit soda
- Garnish: lime or grapefruit wedge

## Preparation

1. Pour the gin, lime juice and grapefruit bitters into a Highball glass
2. Add three ice cubes and stir for 3 seconds
3. Add the grapefruit soda and stir once
4. Garnish with citrus wedge
