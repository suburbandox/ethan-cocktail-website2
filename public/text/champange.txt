The Champagne Cocktail is an elegant libation for elegant people who are in the mood for a less spirit-forward beverage. It does not require vintage bubbly, but the sparkling wine used (Prosecco or Cava are fine alternatives) should be dry and with no objectionable flavors. This cocktail should definitely be built in a tall flute rather than a broad coupe

## Ingredients

- Garnish: Lemon twist

## Preparation

1. Place sugar cube on paper towel and saturate with Angostura bitters
