The Negroni is a grown-up drink. It brings to mind sitting in an Italian cafe, under a large umbrella, sipping a drink while watching the sun set over the Mediterranean Sea. It has a cult following. You either love or hate the sweet/bitter combination.

## Ingredients

- 1 oz gin
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 1 oz Campari
- Garnish: orange wheel

## Preparation

1. Fill a shaker or mixing glass with ice
2. Add the gin, sweet vermouth, and Campari
3. Stir vigorously until well-chilled
4. Pour into chilled (fill with ice and let sit) martini, coupe, or Nick and Nora glass; alternatively you can pour over a single large ice cube in a rocks glass
5. Garnish with orange wheel

## Comments
- The red color in Campari originally came from carmine dye, derived from crushed cochineal insects.
