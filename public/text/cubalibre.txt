The Cuba Libre is simple yet delicious. Possible, but not as good with Diet Coke. Pepsi? Just stay home! If you can, try it with Cuban rum! Of course the drink's title translates as "Free Cuba." Its name in Cuba? "Castro's little lie."

## Preparation

1. Pour the rum and lime juice into a Highball glass

- "Even crumbling from neglect, Havana is the most beautiful city in all of Latin America or the Caribbean. The rum is the finest in the world, bar none. The music fantastic." - Anthony Bourdain
